## Understanding the problem
The challenge is to restore a low resolution image to a high resolution one. Simple enough?? Let's go!

## Preliminary thoughts on how to solve this problem
* Ok I am a noob so do not judge me. (Ok go on. I know this repository is meant to judge me.)
* First, I am thinking of using a convolutional neural net to input the low resolution images and spit out some high resolution images. Let's start with naive and simple solutions!
* Second, I am thinking of using an ensemble of neural nets! You know the saying if one doctor is not enough consult several doctors at once. Well, there are no saying such as those lines I have typed. But yeah, let's try an ensemble. This will be my first time so it will be a fun learning experience.
* Third, OK, at this point in time I don't know what solutions are viable so I would like to consult Dr. Google and Prof. arXiv.

Anyway, I received the challenge today Feb. 07, 2020 and started writing my thoughts this day... duh. What am I even saying!
